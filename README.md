## Introduction
### Project Goals and Motivation
Flight Companion was developed to enhance the travel planning experience, especially for international students and travelers who frequently face long-haul flights with multiple layovers. Our goal is to create a user-friendly web application that aids travelers in planning their trips, optimizing for budget, minimizing layovers, preparing for weather conditions, and providing tailored in-flight entertainment suggestions.

- Minimizing Layovers: Helps users identify flights with fewer or shorter layovers.
- Weather Information: Offers up-to-date weather forecasts for departure and arrival airports.
- Entertainment Recommendations: Suggests movies and shows based on preferences to make long flights enjoyable.

### Application Functionality
- Flight Search: Finds the best flight options based on user-defined source, destination, and travel date.
- Entertainment Recommendations: Personalized movie/TV show recommendations based on user preferences.
- Multi-Stop Travel Planning: Plans round-trip or multi-stop air travel within budgetary constraints.
- Weather Forecast: Provides weather details for departure and arrival airports
